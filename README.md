# LSTM-MetroMan-Comparison
This repository contains code used in the paper "Comparison of LSTM, Auto-LSTM, and MetroMan on SWOT-like Data". 

The code used for MetroMan can be found at [MetroMan](https://github.com/mikedurand/MetroMan).

The main.py file has the LSTM and Auto-LSTM code. The file includes comments explaining what each function's purpose is and how to use the code. We wrote the code this way as we used the same LSTM structure in both models, with the purpose of the code being to evaluate how an autoencoder may alter the results on each test case. The data used can be found at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/3941890).
